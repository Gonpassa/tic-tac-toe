## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Focusing on learning the fundamentals of object-oriented programming this application was built with encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a ton with this project, I also collaborated with another programmer. Pair programming helped me learn how to communicate my ideas to another developer. Making sure that everything was made with OOP principles in mind was a huge restriction and made the problem much harder to solve, but it is very clear how beneficial it is to implement the OOP principles in terms of code organization and understanding. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
